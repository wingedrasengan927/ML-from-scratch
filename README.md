# ML from scratch
This Repository is an attempt to implement the popular ML Algorithms from scratch.
My Main Resources include:
1. Machine Learning in Action by Peter Harrington
2. Andrew NG's Machine Learning Course
3. Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschaka

I've also referenced the articles/blogs that helped me.
